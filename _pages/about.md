I'm WANG Yang, a PhD student at University of Science and Technology of China. My research is centered around AI4S, focusing on AI4Mat framework development, material generation algorithm, and multi-modal spctral integration.

Educations
======
**2021.09-2026.06**: PhD in Physical Chemistry, University of Science and Technology of China (Prof. [Jun Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?&user=KLwebZkAAAAJ))

**2017.09-2021.06**: Bachelor in Material Chemistry, East China University of Science and Technology

Research Interests
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
